Question1
1. a) The "divide and conquer" approach to problem solving is by breaking the
      problem in to parts to solve what it is asking for the problem.
   b) A void method is a method that do not return any statesment. A value-returning method
      is a method that returns a statement by reusing the decleartion
   c) The phrase "pass by value" is when you assign a varible.

8. a) The error for this problem is showValue(int x); You cannot pass a data type with an argument
   b) The error for this problem is that it does not have a main method. In the header if return type is specified
      there must be a return statement.
   c) The error for this problem is that it does not have a main method and in the sayHello method it have a semi-colons.
      To fix the problem remove the semi-colon from the header and never use a method headers terminated by semi-colons.
